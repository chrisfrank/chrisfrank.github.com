Some love is holy, some love is hot  
More often than not my love is a show

All love is risky, yeah, risky and rough  
I have risked enough, been high, been low

Why you gonna act like you don't know when you do?  
I will leave you early one morning  
This is your warning

The words are old ones. I speak to you  
more tested than true, in secondhand sounds

Some words just roll well, right off the tongue  
It's hang or be hung for hanging around  

Why you gonna act like you don't know when you do?  
I will leave you early one morning  
This is your warning
