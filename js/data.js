It&#8217;s a parlor-size Guild, &#8220;parlor-size&#8221; meaning smaller than most guitars on the market. Parlor guitars are named for their part in early 20th century house parties, when guests would gather in the parlor and listen to the hosts&#8217; kids sing and play. Parlor guitars were popular in households that couldn&#8217;t afford pianos. Maybe they&#8217;re tiny because the parlors were tiny; I don&#8217;t know.<\/p>\n\n<p>I love the idea of house guests sitting down for an evening of amateur music, but it seems implausible in New York.

I am too proud and too vain to be anything else.<\/p>\n\n<p>Which is why I was so floored when K borrowed my guitar and played a song she&#8217;d written me. K is a fiction writer, not a songwriter.

If I haven\u2019t found it, here\u2019s hoping I find it somewhere else, because I have just a few weeks left living in this neighborhood.<\/p>\n\n<p>Last weekend, walking home from a birthday party, I passed a group of guys about my age. One of them approached me.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou got a dollar?\u201d he asked.<\/p>\n\n<p>No, I said.<\/p>\n\n<p>He looked me over, skeptical. \u201cYou don\u2019t have one dollar?\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>He had point. I did have a dollar. I meant \u201cNo\u201d the way someone who says \u201cLet\u2019s get together soon\u201d means that seeing you again is not worth planning. What I actually meant was, \u201cI do have a dollar, but not for you.\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cI do have a dollar, but not for you,\u201d I said. He said, \u201cMan, this is the hood. We help each other out here. You don\u2019t have one dollar for me so I can get a blunt?\u201d<\/p>\n\n<p>This pissed me off, I think because I didn\u2019t like being told how we do things here. Here is the South Bronx, where I live, and how we do things here depends minutely on how I do them. I don\u2019t believe I owe a stranger a dollar just because he asks.<\/p>\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you,\u201d I said. I didn\u2019t mean that we\u2019d just met. I meant that our differences were vast and possibly fundamental, that we were likely never to understand each any more deeply than parsing the few sentences we had left to exchange.<\/p>\n\n<p>He understood, I guess, and the number of sentences we had left to exchange was zero. We parted ways without another word, headed for the safety of our respective communities.<\/p>\n\n<p>Which communities? E.B. White, in \u201cHere Is New York\u201d, distinguishes between New York of the native and New York of \u201cthe person who was born somewhere else and came to New York in quest of something.\u201d White means Manhattan, but one can just as well go the Bronx in quest of something.<\/p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. Whereas the kid I was talking to last weekend is, I suspect, a Bronx native, and should he go in quest of something, he\u2019ll probably go questing somewhere else.<\/p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s like to be from the Bronx. I\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s like to be from anywhere but Ithaca, in fact, and this has limited how and with whom I make friends.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are the friends I grew up with, who I know uniquely, in a way that I imagine is similar to the way this kid knows his friends in the Bronx.<\/p>\n\n<p>My own friends in New York are like me: they came here looking for something.<\/p>\n\n<p>My friends in New York are mostly old friends now. We\u2019ve lived in the city nearly five years, enough time to build a community and start calling it home. We\u2019ve done just that \u2014 building mostly in Brooklyn, progressing each year.<\/p>\n\n<p>But by \u201cwe\u201d I mostly mean \u201cthey\u201d, at least since college. Since college I\u2019ve been in the Bronx, which, it turns out, is further from Brooklyn than it looks on a map. Did I come here to build a community? From scratch? In a place where people don\u2019t come questing and don\u2019t, when they can help it, come visit?<\/p>\n\n<p>What could possibly have made that seem like a good idea?<\/p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. What I\u2019ve been thinking thinking lately, though, is straightforward:<\/p>\n\n<p>I miss my friends.<\/p>"},{"blog_name":"thenepotist","id":32962045952,"post_url":"http:\/\/thenepotist.tumblr.com\/post\/32962045952\/missing-is-my-mother-who-took-the-photos-shes","slug":"missing-is-my-mother-who-took-the-photos-shes","type":"photo","date":"2011-05-14 04:00:00 GMT","timestamp":1305345600,"state":"published","format":"markdown","reblog_key":"LwZjHFbL","tags":[],"short_url":"http:\/\/tmblr.co\/ZNR0YyUiiEW0","highlighted":[],"note_count":0,"caption":"<p>Missing is my mother, who took the photos.
