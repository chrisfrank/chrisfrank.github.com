With wings on our backs  
we wouldn't have to wear such silly clothes  
we wouldn't have to walk everywhere we go

Every time an angel sings, I look up  
Everything she looks like looks so  
left, the left eye left of the nose

Write for me  
I like names and sentences  
And if we take apart  
take me one by one  
one by one  
one by one  
one by one

The kind of tired that you get  
long long run  
by the time the point had hit home  
there wasn't so much home to hit

I would get like that I think if I  
I hit home  
even if there's just one thing to know  
we'll see it if we take a little bit

Write for me  
I like names and sentences  
And if we take apart,  
take me one by one  
one by one  
one by one  
one by one  
one by one  
one by one  
one by one  
one by one
