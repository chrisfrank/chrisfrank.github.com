Like the first rays of the rising sun  
Like the bit of God in everyone  
My love is just for you

Like the music on the radio  
Like a rerun of a TV show  
Our love is original and new

I'm gonna love you til the sun comes up  
Until the sun comes up  
And when the sun  
comes up I will be lost  
and I'll be lost until I love someone

Like my favorite year of middle school  
Like a goldfish in a swimming pool  
Our love is gonna last

From my history of running out  
to the problems we don't know about  
yes our love is gonna last

I'm gonna love you til the sun comes up  
Until the sun comes up  
And when the sun  
comes up I will be lost  
and I'll be lost until I love someone

In the pages of a magazine  
In a celebrated move scene  
Our love is gonna last

From my history of giving up  
to what's about to be an empty cup  
my heart beats a little fast

I'm gonna love you til the sun comes up  
Until the sun comes up  
And when the sun  
comes up I will be lost  
and I'll be lost until I love someone
