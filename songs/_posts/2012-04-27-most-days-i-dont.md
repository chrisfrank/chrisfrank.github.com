You think you know the place  
Surprise, six months, lies, your fists, my face  
Just when you hold something  
Oh no, look there goes, love is setting in

I will tell you that I love you  
Maybe most days I don't  
I'll love you forever  
unless I won't

Tied up and tongue tied  
for no one, for no one, for you  
Speechless and wide-eyed  
for no one, for no one, for you

I will tell you that I love you  
Maybe most days I don't  
I'll love you forever  
unless I won't

Tell me how does a good man do what he does?  
And why, when nothing is serious, this was?

I will tell you that I love you  
Maybe most days I don't  
I'll love you forever  
unless I won't
