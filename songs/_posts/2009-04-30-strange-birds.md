one sheet of glass to the river  
guess who got a window seat?  
nobody swims in the river  
everybody's saving heat

strange birds sit still  
right on the power line  
they make no sound  
just an arrival sign

and mornings are mostly for breakfast  
and I brought nothing to eat  
I do not buy any breakfast, hey  
I bought a window seat

strange birds sit still  
right on the power line  
they make no sound  
just an arrival sign

I remember what you said to me:  
"the water is drawn from wells."  
though I don't see what you, sir, must see  
this morning I hear you well

strange birds sit still  
right on the power line  
they make no sound  
just an arrival sign
