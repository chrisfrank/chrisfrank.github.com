If I have a boy then I will call him Autumn  
and he will spend his summers in the sun  
He needs his light and you needed none

There are flowers coming out of your grave  
and your grave is baking in the sun  
I remain and I will give what you gave  
what you gave the way you should have done  
The way you should have

If I have a girl then I will be forgotten  
and everyone will say she looks like you  
But her work is soft and her words are true

There are flowers coming out of your grave  
and your grave is baking in the sun  
I remain and I will give what you gave  
what you gave the way you should have done  
The way you should have
