"Who wants to go to sleep?  
who wants to go to rome?"  
That's really all he says, so  
maybe somebody take him home?

And we sleepers, in shifts getâ€¦  
we sleep with anyone we can  
That's not what he said but  
that is what I understand

Nobody's holding me yet, please get  
your hands back to where they came from  
We are just speakers and this just a room  
There are millions of us, I've seen some

Who wants to read ahead?  
All of the good stuff's at the end  
That's not what he said but  
that is what I understand

Listen, she's singing sharai sharai  
listen, she's living in the walls  
There are no words to know her by  
but you will know her when she calls  
Soon, I would love to believe  
If not soon, though, somewhen  
Waiting again we will walk until then  
left foot right, left foot right

Somebody set the weights  
He tore a book in two  
We only speak in shapes  
and somebody's shaped like you

I carry so many weights in my head  
you can move we with levers and string  
Waiting to move me with words won't move much  
I can read into everything

Listen, she's singing sharai sharai  
listen, she's living in the walls  
There are no words to know her by  
but you will know her when she calls  
Soon, I would love to believe  
If not soon, though, somewhen  
Waiting again we will walk until then  
left foot right, left foot right
