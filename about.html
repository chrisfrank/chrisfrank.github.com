    The Nepotist makes music the Village Voice calls “moving alt-soul.” Frontmen Chris and Hayden Frank, brothers, grew up in Ithaca, NY, playing in separate bands. They started the Nepotist in New York City in 2012. Since releasing a series of session videos this spring, they’ve been hard at work on their debut LP, due out in January 2015.
