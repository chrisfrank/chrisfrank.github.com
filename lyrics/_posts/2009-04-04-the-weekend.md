like a lightbulb  
off and on  
I do one thing well

I took the money  
money's gone  
we met at a friend's hotel

we stay all night  
we stay all night when we can

she has to happen  
I have to be  
that was the work to be done

we opened the curtains  
drew the blinds  
we worked for everyone

we stay all night  
we stay all night  
we stay all night when we can  
we stay all night

we came for the weekend and  
just for the weekend and  
then the weekend was gone  
that word is the same  
in every language  
that word goes on and on

I wrote a letter  
full of untranslatable things  
I sent nothing, not today  
today some memory sings

in color and seasons  
the letter "I"  
rules of grammar and games

a couple of lessons  
mostly wrong  
a couple of numbers and names

we stay all night  
we stay all night  
we stay all night  
we stay all night

we came for the weekend and  
just for the weekend and  
then the weekend was gone  
that word is the same  
in every language  
that word goes on and on
