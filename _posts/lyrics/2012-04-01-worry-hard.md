When I worry, I never worry for you  
You might think it's because I think you're strong  
You think that if you want you will be wrong  
I don't worry because I don't care, it's true

Dear I hope your hearing goes  
and I hope your hair falls out  
Love I hope your marriage fails  
'cause that will give me something to laugh about

When I woke up, I didn't wonder what for  
I will leave the building while you sleep  
wonder if the wound is getting deep  
It is dark still when I'm out your door

Dear I hope your hearing goes  
and I hope your hair falls out  
Love I hope you drink too much  
'cause that will give me something to laugh about

In the morning, in the evening, all night  
I hope the phone continues not to ring  
As long as we're not speaking I can sing  
La la, you're wrong, I'm right  
La la, you're wrong, I'm right  
La la la la la la
