Meet me in back of a battle  
Meet me in a heavy rain  
Put me on my back and straddle  
Feel no pain, feel no  

I live just left of the middle  
over a motorway  
Though the rooms are few and little  
You can stay, you can

Look me up, look me down 
Look me over and over  
'til your worries all drown  
Stay the night  
Stay the year  
Stay over and over  
'til the river runs clear  

Meet me in an empty city  
Meet me on a subway train  
Meet me when you're pure and pretty  
Feel no pain, feel no  

I sleep eight hours each evening  
because I am Serious Man  
May I stay awake for weeks with you?  
Because I can, 'cause I 

Look me up, look me down  
Look me over and over  
'til your worries all drown  
Stay the night  
Stay the year  
Stay over and over  
'til the river runs clear
