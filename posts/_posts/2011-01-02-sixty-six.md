Hayden came over yesterday to record vocals on a birthday present for our dad. After just a few takes, I had to stop him from recording over a vocal that was already really good. Then he had to stop me right back from recording over a good harmony. Why is it so easy to judge someone else’s performance and so hard to judge your own?

Dad is 66 today, and is probably working on his manuscript right now. Over Christmas he said something like, “Well, I wish I were a better writer, but this book is nearly as good as I can make it.” 

Happy birthday, Dad. I hope I can learn to judge my work like you judge yours before I’m 66.
