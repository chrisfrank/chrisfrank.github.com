The protagonists from my last post reappeared this week. Whatever ordeal the NYPD put them through was apparently short, because they are again drumming on the 4 and 5 trains.

Some people, probably most people, just want to be left alone while they get to where they are going. I am one. This is an okay thing to want.

The drummers do not think so. Most people say hello to others, but not these two. They say hello at others. A woman turned around when they started playing, so they stopped. “Hello!” one said at her. ”You think you can turn you back on us and we will disappear?”

Obviously, no. She just wanted to be left alone. But they kept calling at her, trying to make a show of her negativity, trying to shame her.

These positive people either don’t get hypocrisy, or don’t care.
