I am waiting for coffee to brew. I will drink it, then record vocals on a few demos.

This is not so unusual a situation for me to find myself in. What is unusual is that I haven’t spoken to anyone yet today, and unless someone calls in the next few minutes, the very first words out of my mouth will be sung and recorded. I even know what the words will be, because I know which song I’m starting with.

I cannot ever remember waking up and knowing exactly what the first words out of my mouth would be.

First words are like private first impressions of oneself each day. You don’t usually get to pick them. You just notice whichever words are first out of your mouth and go, “Aha, I must be sharp/slow/sad/romantic/giddy today”. Once I woke up five minutes before a bus I had to catch. The first word out of my mouth was “FUCK!”, as were I think the next seven words, and that day I was irritable.

Today my first words will be these:

First snow in a new city
“Not your city” says snow
Not yet, as it fits better
what becomes of the city you know?
All your friends getting married
You should have said no

In a snow suit and thick boots at sunrise
I march through somebody’s back yard
Stare in through the windows, the dog knows
Don’t worry I, too, stand guard
I don’t have to hit often
I always hit hard

Birds come back
once each year
I came back boys
Not one of you is here
I don’t believe us
Leave us
Four in the corners
Four in the form

I don’t worry for you boy, I know we’ll be speaking
Tin cans and string
You, man, on the next hand for you man I worry
I know no such thing
I know you’re a singer
I’ve heard you sing

Oh

Birds come back
once each year
I came back boys
Not one of you is here
I don’t believe us
Leave us
Four in the corners
Four in the form
