If you don't miss me  
why is your grip so strong?  
And if I am leaving  
why do I stay so long?

You are such trouble  
You in your weekend clothes  
Who you dressed up for?  
Killing the whole room knows

When you nod from across the room to say  
hello in a we're-not-speaking way  
then I know where I will sleep tonight  
And the whole room knows it too  
but I don't mention this, and nor do you  
Some things, when you say them, they don't stay alright 

Somebody asks me  
I will deny, deny  
Somebody asks you  
woman lie, just lie

When you nod from across the room to say  
hello in a we're-not-speaking way  
then I know where I will sleep tonight  
And the whole room knows it too  
but I don't mention this, and nor do you  
Some things, when you say them, they don't stay alright
