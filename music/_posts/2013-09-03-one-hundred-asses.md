A hundred asses in 3D glasses  
sinking low in their seats  
sharing popcorn and Coca-Cola  
keeping out of the heat

slowly thinking, daytime drinking  
your lipstick stuck to the rim  
river water is all around us  
and there is nowhere to swim

one for everyone we was  
two for who we'll be  
three times seven years of waiting  
fourth time's for me

short white dresses, skin impresses  
we parade down the street  
twenty-somethings both dressed to kill  
from our heads to our toes

one for everyone we was,  
two for who we'll be  
three times seven years of waiting

daylight breaking, me mistaking  
somebody's gait for your own  
three times in as many hours  
guess it's time I get home
