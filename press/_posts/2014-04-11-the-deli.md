Who says you can't find gritty rock soul in New York anymore? For The Nepotist, they've made our town home to the sound of Delta blues, tied with a bow to the down-home hard-hitting rock that The Black Keys are mixed up with, and screwed tight with a groove that could only come from a pair of musicians who have been working together for some time now. For these two brothers, the songs come naturally, with enough feel between them each to even do a pretty convincing cover of Bill Withers' 'Ain't No Sunshine.' Check out latest track and video 'Firehouse' below (it's a Deli premiere!), and join them when they play Cameo Gallery on Thu, Apr 17th. - Mike Levine (@Goldnuggets)
