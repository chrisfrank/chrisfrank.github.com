quote: moving alt-soul perfect for the cold weather

From Ithaca, NY come the Nepotist -- a pair of siblings that make moving alt-soul perfect for the cold weather outside. Chris and Hayden Frank bring their smattering of old and new school influences back to Rockwood for a late-night, free show, and their talent will definitely convince you that they got there by more than a little nepotism. -- By Brittany Spanos
